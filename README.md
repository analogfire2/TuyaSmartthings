# TuyaSmartthings

Currently PARTIALLY functional SmartThings device handler and node.js script for TuyAPI supported devices

## Requires

1. codetheweb/tuyapi
   - npm install codetheweb/tuyapi
   
2. DevID and localKey
   - see one of the links below in order to find your specific keys. I used Android ADB to find the localkey(no root required)

Device Handler and Node script hacked together using DaveGut's TPLink script as a starting point.

## Update
ECallegari
-Updated the node.js file to work with latest codetheweb/tuyapi
-Updated the DTH to match with the updated node.js
